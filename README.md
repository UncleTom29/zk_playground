# zk_playground
ZK-Playground is an interactive browser-based environment for learning and testing Zero-Knowledge circuits with Noir, featuring live deployment to Solana. Think "CodeSandbox for ZK proofs" - users can write Noir code, generate proofs, verify them, and deploy verifiers to Solana devnet/mainnet with one click.
